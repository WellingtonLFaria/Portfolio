My biggest challenge in this project was assuming the role of Scrum Master for the first time. During the initial two sprints, I struggled significantly to gather the team and identify the issues they were facing, as communication has always been one of my weaker areas. Another challenge I encountered early on was starting the project development using a project management platform with which I wasn't familiar. This made it difficult for the team to track the project's progress. By the second sprint, I switched to a different project management platform that both the team and I felt more comfortable using.",technologies:["GIT","HTML","CSS","Bulma CSS","React","JavaScript","Java","SpringBoot"],softSkills:["Planning","Work under pressure"],whatCanImprove:["Planning","Time management"],link:"https://github.com/Grupo-Syntax-Squad/AssetBox"},{name:"Tup\xe3",anoSemestre:"2024-2",academicPartner:"Tecsus",description:"The project aims to create a monitoring system for low-cost weather stations, recording data from sensors such as wind, rain, humidity, temperature and pressure.

We have also developed a consumer service responsible for receiving, processing and storing data transmitted by railway stations.
